Hypothesis: There is a large difference between the customer survey results. After completing the ANOVA test, we found that the sum of squares is equal to 3.5, the degrees of freedom is equal to 7, and the critical f-value is .856288. Now we look at the compare the critcal f-value and f-value. If the f-value is greater than the critical f-value (.856288) then we reject the null hypothesis and if it is less than the critical f-value, then we do not reject the null hypothesis. The f-value was .470908, which means it was less than the critical f-value and we do not reject the null hypothesis. Since we do not reject the null hypothesis, this means there is not a significant difference between the customer survey results to determine the order of importance in the survey factors. (Davila 2016)\n\n### 2.  The data we currently have does not lead to any information that is helpful in determining the most important factors from the customers through the survey questions. We cannot correlate any trends because the differences between the survey question are not large enough.\n\n### 3.  Based on what we have seen from our analysis we could recommend better survey questions and rating system to help us identify an order of importance from customers when it comes to attributes of the service. Moving forward after creation of a better rating system, we could then identify what needs to change from the service in order to slow down customer churn and provide a better service.
